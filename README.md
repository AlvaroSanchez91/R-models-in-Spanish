# Machine Learning models in Spanish using R.

Here we can see some exercises of Machine Learning using R, and all of it explained in Spanish.
I recomend reading the .md documents in the web, and download the .Rmd to run it using R.

## Cluster_PC_Tree

Diferents data sets are used here to show examples of clustering, principal components analysis, and decision trees.

## Knn
Using "datawork.csv" we have to do two predictive models, one of regression, and the other of clasification (we use
two diferent columns to do that).

## Gam

### Exercise 1:
Using the data Auto from the library ISLR, we have to make a predictive model. We should use a generalized linear model (such as poisson model).

### Exercise 2:
Using the data college of the library ISLR, we have to make a gam model in order to predict the Grad.Rate variable.
